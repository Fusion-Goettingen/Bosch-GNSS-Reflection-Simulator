To start the software, run the file Code/main.m and execute all steps

Temporary results are stored in the Data_temp folder, so that all the steps do not need to be redone every time

Results are stored in the Results folder

The ranging codes should be stored in the RangingCodes folders. They can be accessed at, e.g., https://github.com/danipascual/GNSS-matlab/tree/master/prn_codes
